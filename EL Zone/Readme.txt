This DCTL requires a linear signal. It then assigns each stop (and sometimes half-stop) of light a colour for monitoring purposes. The colours match the EL Zone system for better integration with that workflow. 

Use a CST to transform from whatever log gamma you are in to Linear before sending it through the DCTL. TURN OFF ALL TONE MAPPING.
