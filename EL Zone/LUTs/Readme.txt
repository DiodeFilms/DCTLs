I exported several LUTs for use with monitors and cameras. Pick the one that matches the log gamma that your camera records in.

If you're using on a monitor, remember you'll need to switch off any LUTs your camera may be applying before sending the signal.

If you want to use the LUT on a panasonic camera, use the .vlt file as panasonic cameras don't use .cube.
